# Simple deep learning

The field of deep learning is vast. The sheer number of publications on the subject is enough to overwhelm anyone. In the series "Simple deep learning" we'll be taking a step back. We'll forget about the latest tips and tricks that are pushing the state of the art. Instead, through the use of simple datasets and toy problems, we'll explore the basis of deep learning to give you a better understanding of the big picture.

This series currently contains the following posts:
- MNIST extended: a simple dataset for image segmentation and object localisation
- A simple example of semantic segmentation.
